# Hi, HR

>NOTE: In this repo of mine, there will be certain changes compared to the template repo, but solely for the purpose of making it easier for HR to review and saving HR's time. I would like to request permission to put all the issues into different components and showcase them on a webpage instead of separating them into individual folders. Thank you.
